# spectral-clustering-project
Spectral Clustering implementation in C and Python using Python C-API and NumPy C-API.
Spectral clustering is a technique with roots in graph theory, where the approach is used to identify communities of nodes in a graph based on the edges connecting them.
The technique makes use of the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix of the data points to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering the data - by k-means (in this implementation).
Various techniques including "Normalized spectral clustering according to Ng, Jordan, and Weiss (2002)" which implemented here are discussed in the paper: [A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering.pdf](A%20Tutorial%20on%20Spectral%20Clustering.pdf)  
The project requirements: [project description.pdf](project%20description.pdf)
